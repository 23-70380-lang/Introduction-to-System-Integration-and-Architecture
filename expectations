I expect that in this course, we will learn more concepts and engage in activities that are directly related to our program. I believe that the lessons 
and tasks will help us further develop our knowledge and skills, especially since they are aligned with our chosen field. It is important for me to gain 
insights and skills that I can apply in real-life situations in the future.

Based on the course title, I also expect that the scope of the activities will be broader compared to what we have experienced in previous courses last year.
This will not only focus on learning theories but also on applying them in a deeper and more meaningful way. Because of this, I assumed that the tasks will be 
more challenging yet valuable to our overall learning experience.

I expect that this course will truly test our abilities, knowledge, skills and understanding. I believe that through the challenges we will face, we can further 
strengthen our skills as students. Most importantly, I hope that this will be a valuable experience that will prepare us for higher levels of learning and for our 
future profession. I know it will become more harder than before, so we need to focus and adjust.
